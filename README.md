# Social Economy Simulator

The Social Economy  Simulator implements a sand box testing facility of the 
SBchain project, allowing interested user to generate mock benefit allocation populations with
specific characteristics and simulate runs of the SBchain system for a predefined amount of time. 

The source code contained within this repository contains the backend and front
end of the Simulator. To start the server, build the project using Maven
and then resulting server listens to the port 8081. Alternative, a docker-compose
file is available within this repository for easier deployment. 

Finally, a working instance of the Simulator is available at http://dss.aegean.gr:8081

Follow the instructions of the application to:
* generate a random Social Economy population
* bootstrap that population to the system
* execute a Social Security Income benefit allocation simulation
* review the results of the simulation
* export reports
